### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Martin, an experienced software engineer from Bulgaria. I am an open source believer and a member of [several](https://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=mgrigorov) [open](https://openhpc.community) [source](https://github.com/bioconda) projects.

Currently I work on making server-side software better prepared for the ARM64 revolution!
